            <h2>Our Worship Service</h2>
                <p>
                    Our morning worship service is the life-wire of our ministry. It is in this service that we celebrate who God is, what he has done, and continues to do in our lives. He is worthy of our praises because he is not only our Savior, but our Provider and King who reigns supreme in our lives and the entire universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The morning service is designed to present the truths about God and his saving acts in a way that is dynamic, powerful, and accessible to the city dwellers. People exploring Christianity enjoy the power, beauty, and relevance of the cross in their lives as they join in worship with us. Our worship team is there to minister to us in a mighty way as they feature contemporary worship music throughout the service.
